    <h1>Seeking Technical Co-Founder</h1>
    <p>Join a mission-driven startup solving real problems for small businesses seeking funding. This is a ground-floor equity opportunity — not a job posting.</p>

    <h2>What We’re Building</h2>
    <p>We’re developing a SaaS platform that helps small business owners prepare clean, lender-ready funding packages. Our system streamlines document prep, improves borrower readiness, and creates trust between applicants and lenders.</p>
    <p>This isn’t a fintech lender — it’s a toolkit built from an underwriter’s point of view to serve both borrowers and capital providers.</p>

    <h2>About the Founder</h2>
    <p>I’ve spent over 40 years starting, funding, and operating businesses across industries — including finance, education, aviation, real estate, agriculture, and SaaS. I’ve built and sold companies, raised capital for my own ventures, and helped others navigate the funding landscape successfully. This project is a culmination of my experience — and a way to solve a problem I’ve lived through many times. I’m looking for a technical partner who shares the same drive for building something meaningful with a clear path to growth and exit.</p>

    <h2>Who You Are</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Experienced IT leader, developer, or architect</li>
      <li>Have built and launched secure, scalable SaaS platforms</li>
      <li>Understand cloud infrastructure, data privacy, and user experience</li>
      <li>Looking to build for equity — not just a salary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What’s In It for You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Meaningful equity ownership</li>
      <li>Strategic input and tech leadership</li>
      <li>Flexible role (hands-on or leading a team)</li>
      <li>A 3–5 year plan to scale and exit (via acquisition or IPO)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where We Are Now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-world problem with proven demand</li>
      <li>Business model, financial projections, and early UI mockups complete</li>
      <li>Open tech stack — your input will shape it</li>
      <li>Ready to move with the right partner</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Ready to Talk?</h2>
      <p>If you’re an experienced builder looking to own something meaningful — let’s connect.</p>
